Lecture 1 Shell scripting basics
-----------

Some very useful shell programs:
* `man PROGRAM_NAME` program_name: accessing manual page
* `ls -l DIR` listing long info under a directory.
* `OUTPUT > file` wire OUTPUT into the file 
* `PROGRAM < file` wire file into the PROGRAM
* `>>` appending to a file
* `|` piping
* `grep KEYWORD DIR` return lines that include the KEYWORD under DIR

Logging in as the root user allow you to do crazier things, via the `sudo` command
